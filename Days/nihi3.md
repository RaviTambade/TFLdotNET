Yesterday, we paused at a very interesting checkpoint.
We were talking about **how .NET applications are built, compiled, and executed**. I told you that whenever you build your project, your **C# compiler** doesn’t directly compile code into machine code — instead it compiles into something called **IL code (Intermediate Language code)**.

This IL code is universal inside the .NET ecosystem. You can think of it like a *common script language* which every .NET-supported programming language translates into. And who understands this IL code? Our **CLR — Common Language Runtime**, the heart of the .NET execution engine.

Now, remember we spoke about `EXE` vs `DLL`.

* An **EXE** is like your main driver, the entry point of the application.
* A **DLL** is like a reusable library — your plug-and-play modules, replaceable and extendable without breaking the main system.

That’s why in a real project, you’ll always see your business modules packaged as DLLs, and only the front console or startup project is an EXE. This separation gives you flexibility for future sprint cycles — you can add new features in DLLs without rewriting the whole product.

Then, we moved on to the **execution model**. We said:

* Every running application instance is called a **process**.
* A process itself doesn’t execute code; it’s a **passive kernel object**.
* The actual execution path is handled by **threads**, which are **active kernel objects**.

By default, .NET applications are **multi-threaded**.

* The **primary thread** starts execution from your `Main()` method.
* Another special thread works silently in the background: the **Garbage Collector thread**. It’s responsible for memory management, cleaning unused objects from the heap, so that you don’t have to worry about `malloc` and `free` like in C/C++.

This means, when you allocate an object in C#, the **reference** is stored on the stack, while the **actual object** lives in the heap. And that heap memory is shared across threads — so multiple threads can access those objects, but their references remain thread-specific on the stack.

Now, I compared this with other runtimes:

* In **JavaScript**, your Node.js runtime uses the **V8 engine** to run JS code.
* In **Java**, you have the **JVM**.
* In .NET, we have the **CLR**, which does memory management, JIT compilation, and exception handling for us.


Now that was the recap. Today’s journey goes deeper.

👉 **Agenda for Today:**
We are going to touch a very interesting and powerful concept in C#:
**Events and Delegates.**

Why? Because when we move towards **event-driven applications** (which is the reality of most backend business systems — they respond to triggers, user actions, API calls, messages, database updates), delegates and events are the backbone.

Think of a **delegate** as a *contract or a pointer to a function*. It allows you to say:

> “I don’t know today which exact function will run, but I guarantee it will match this signature.”

And an **event** is like a *notification system built on top of delegates*.

Let me give you a mentor’s story analogy:

Imagine we are in an office. There is a **fire alarm system** installed.

* The **alarm bell** doesn’t know *who* will respond — security, employees, or firefighters.
* All it does is **raise an event**: *“FireDetected!”*.
* Whoever has subscribed (security guard, manager, safety officer) will get notified and act accordingly.

This is exactly how **events in C#** work. They are powered by delegates — delegates act like the *phone line connections*, and the event is the *broadcast message*.

So today, we will:

1. Understand what delegates are and how to declare them.
2. Learn about multicast delegates (one event, multiple listeners).
3. Explore how events are declared and used in C#.
4. Tie this concept back to real-world applications like backend services, logging systems, notification systems, etc.



✅ So let’s keep our yesterday’s learning — process, threads, CLR, memory management — as our **foundation stone**, and today we are building the next floor of the building: **event-driven programming with delegates and events**.

**Ravi (mentor smiling, holding a marker):**
“Alright team, so yesterday we drilled down into the *engine room* of .NET — processes, threads, CLR, memory. That was like understanding the **chassis and engine** of a car.

But today… we put our hands on the **steering wheel**. Because applications are not just sitting silently in memory. They are alive. They respond. They react.

And that brings us to our topic:
👉 **Events and Delegates.**

**Ravi (mentor draws on the board):**
First, let’s imagine this room has a **fire alarm**.

* When smoke is detected, the alarm **rings**.
* Now here’s the catch: the alarm has *no clue* who will react.

  * Maybe the **security guard** will run to check.
  * Maybe the **fire department** will be notified.
  * Maybe the **building manager** gets an SMS.

The alarm simply says: *“FireDetected!”*.
Whoever is interested in that event subscribes, and when the bell rings — all subscribers are notified.

That’s exactly how **events in C#** work.


**Ravi (mentor slows down):**
But before events, we need something more fundamental.
That’s where **delegates** come in.

A **delegate** is like a *phone line*.
You don’t know who will pick up on the other side, but you know the line is valid and the voice will match the expected format.

In C#, a delegate defines:

> “I will point to a function that has *this signature* — specific return type and parameters.”

So a delegate acts like a **function contract**.

**Quick Example (mentor style code explanation):**

```csharp
// Step 1: Define a delegate (contract)
public delegate void FireAlert(string location);

// Step 2: Define subscribers (methods that match the delegate signature)
public class Security
{
    public void Notify(string location)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Security rushing to {location}!");
    }
}

public class FireDepartment
{
    public void Notify(string location)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Fire department notified for {location}!");
    }
}

// Step 3: Raise event using delegate
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Delegate instance
        FireAlert fireAlert;

        Security sec = new Security();
        FireDepartment dept = new FireDepartment();

        // Subscribers attach to delegate
        fireAlert = sec.Notify;
        fireAlert += dept.Notify;

        // Event raised (alarm rings!)
        fireAlert("Server Room");
    }
}
```

**Ravi (mentor claps hands):**
Now see what just happened.

* The **delegate** was the *phone line*.
* The **event trigger** was the fire alarm.
* Multiple subscribers responded automatically — Security AND Fire Department.

This is called a **multicast delegate** — one signal, many listeners.

**Ravi (mentor connects to real-world projects):**
In your backend business applications, this is *everywhere*:

* When a new **order** is placed, the system raises an event.

  * Inventory module decreases stock.
  * Billing module generates invoice.
  * Notification module sends email.

All triggered by **one event** — just like our fire alarm.

✅ So today, our flow will be:

1. Understand delegates with real code.
2. Move into events — the official way to declare *“this delegate is for notification.”*
3. Discuss real-world applications (logging, monitoring, notifications, messaging).
4. Practice a mini-scenario: build an event-driven HR module.

**Ravi (mentor smiling, homework tone):**
Now before we dive into the syntax-heavy part, I want to ask you:
👉 If yesterday we said CLR is like the **engine** of the system, what analogy would you give for **events and delegates** in a car?

**Ravi (mentor, smiling and adjusting glasses):**
“Otherwise, what will happen, friends — you will keep feeling like *Ravi is explaining, we are understanding, code looks so simple, all is good*… but in reality, when you are put on the ground, your seniors will expect you to be hands-on, *writing and running the code yourself*.

So, who has to make that transition? 👉 Only you.
That’s why, I am planning today’s session in two parts:

1. First, till about **10:50**, I’ll explain and demonstrate concepts, walk you through the ideas step by step.
2. Then, after that, we’ll switch gears. You will **code along** with me, share your screens if needed, and we’ll solve small problems together.

That way, you won’t just understand theory — you’ll *own it* by typing, debugging, and seeing the output with your own eyes.

How does that sound?”


**Tushar:**
“Yes, Ravi.”

**Ravi (nodding, a little doubtful but smiling):**
“Hmm, I was a little unsure if the time will suit everyone, but let’s try. We’ll keep the **interactive hands-on** at 10:50. During that time, I’ll also sit with you — guiding, correcting, but you will be the one coding. That’s the only way you’ll gain confidence.”

**Ravi (looking at the group):**
“Before I go deeper into today’s agenda, let me pause.
👉 Anyone has any questions from **Day 1 or Day 2** topics? Or any curiosity that is still pending in your mind?”

**Jagdish:**
“I think it’s perfect so far, Ravi. Enough for the start.”

**Kanaad:**
“Ravi, can you please open that **heap memory diagram** once again?”


**Ravi (quickly bringing up the diagram):**
“Yes, this one here. See on the left, the process… on the right, stack and heap memory.”

**Kanaad:**
“Okay, so whenever we run the project, are we creating this memory each time? Or is it already there?”

**Ravi (patiently, storytelling tone):**
“Good question. Let me clarify.

When you **build** the project (`dotnet build`), your source code is compiled into EXE or DLL — just binary files on disk. At this stage, there is **no process, no heap, no stack** for your application yet.

The real action starts only when you **run** (`dotnet run`). At that point:

1. The OS creates a **process** — a virtual address space.
2. Inside that process, the **heap** area is reserved for dynamic objects.
3. The OS also assigns a **primary thread** to the process. Each thread gets its own **stack**.
4. And only then your `Main()` method is called.

So remember this simple line:
👉 **Build-time = only binaries created. Run-time = process, heap, stack, threads come alive.**

That’s why we call heap + stack the *runtime memory* of a process.”

**Kanaad (nodding):**
“Ahh, got it. So when we close the application, all this memory goes away?”

**Ravi:**
“Exactly! When you terminate the application:

* The process dies.
* All threads die.
* Heap and stack memory allocated to that process are released back to the OS.

So, everything your app borrowed from the OS is given back. That’s why we say: *process is a temporary container for your running application*.”


**Ravi (closing the memory diagram, smiling):**
“Alright, friends — so far we’ve seen how memory works at runtime, how heap and stack come alive only when your process starts, and how everything is cleaned up when the process ends.

Now let’s slowly move to today’s main agenda: **events and delegates**.

Why am I connecting memory and delegates?
Because delegates are nothing but **special objects** sitting on the heap. They point to methods. So the memory story doesn’t end here — it continues when we start wiring up behavior.”

**Jagdish (curious):**
“Ravi, when you say delegate is an object, does that mean it behaves like our normal class objects?”

**Ravi (leaning forward, storytelling tone):**
“Excellent catch, Jagdish. Yes, a delegate is indeed a **class type**, secretly created by the compiler for you. When you declare a delegate, behind the scenes the compiler generates a class — and when you instantiate it, you are creating an **object on the heap**.

The only special thing? That object stores a **reference to a method** instead of normal data.
So in one line:
👉 *Delegate = Object + Method Reference.*”


**Kanaad (scribbling in notes):**
“So basically like a pointer to a function, right?”

**Ravi (smiling, using his hands to draw in air):**
“Exactly, but with C# safety. In C++ you have raw function pointers — dangerous, you can point to invalid memory. In C#, a delegate is a safe wrapper: it knows the signature, it checks the type, and the runtime won’t allow mismatches.

So yes, a delegate is a ‘type-safe function pointer’.”

**Tushar:**
“Okay Ravi, then why do we need events if we already have delegates?”

**Ravi (leans back, storytelling):**
“Beautiful question, Tushar. Let me give you a story.

Imagine you are organizing a cricket match in your colony. You tell your friends: *‘Whenever the match starts, I’ll call you.’*

* You keep a list of all friends’ phone numbers.
* At the right time, you dial each number and inform them.

This ‘phone list’ is like your delegate list — a multicast delegate, in fact.

Now, if you don’t want random people modifying your list — like someone adding fake numbers or deleting entries — you put a rule: *Only I, the organizer, can trigger the call.*
That restriction is what we call an **event**.

So:
👉 Delegate = mechanism to call methods.
👉 Event = delegate + protection (only publisher can raise it).

Is the picture getting clearer?”

**Arif (nodding):**
“Yes, Ravi, makes sense. Delegate is the engine, event is the rule on top.”


**Ravi (grinning):**
“Exactly, Arif! Nicely put.

Now, what we’ll do after 10:50: I’ll give you a **small problem** — like building a cricket match notifier. You will write code using delegates and events. I’ll watch, guide, and help debug.

That way, you won’t just *hear* the story — you’ll actually *live it in code.*”

**Arif (raising hand, politely):**
“Ravi, I have a question, sorry to interrupt.”


**Ravi (smiling, encouraging):**
“No no, Arif, please — interruptions are welcome. This is how we keep it alive. Tell me.”

**Arif:**
“You just said *event is declared using delegate*. But why can’t we directly write an event like a function inside the class? Why do we need a delegate first?”

**Ravi (nodding, adjusting glasses):**
“Very good doubt. Listen carefully.

Think of it like this:
An event is not just a *method call*. It’s a **subscription model**.

👉 To manage subscriptions, we need a **list of compatible functions**.
👉 That list has to be of a specific type — same parameters, same return type.

So, how do we define that type? That’s exactly what a **delegate** does.

Delegate acts like a *contract* that says:

> ‘All event handlers must look like this — same input, same output.’

Then, the event uses that delegate to maintain a list of subscribers.

So:

* Delegate = defines the *shape of methods*.
* Event = uses that delegate to broadcast notifications safely.”


**Tushar (leaning forward):**
“Ahh, so event cannot exist without delegate first, right?”


**Ravi:**
“Exactly, Tushar! Think of delegate as the **blueprint**, and event as the **building** constructed on that blueprint. Without a delegate, event won’t even compile.”


**Ravi (turning to the class, drawing flow on whiteboard):**
“Now let’s go back to our banking example.

* Account has **balance**.
* Account has **Deposit()** and **Withdraw()**.
* If balance < ₹10,000 after withdrawal → we want to raise an **event**.
* That event will say: *UnderBalance event triggered.*
* Some other class (like SMSNotifier, EmailNotifier, Auditor) will **subscribe** to this event and act.”


**Ravi (storytelling analogy):**
“It’s like a fire alarm. The alarm itself (Account) doesn’t know who will run — security, fire brigade, employees.
It only **raises the alarm** (event). Whoever has registered will respond.

That’s how loosely coupled systems are built.”

**Kanaad (scribbling):**
“Ravi, so step one is: define delegate. Step two: define event using that delegate. Step three: raise event in Withdraw method. Step four: some other class will handle it?”

**Ravi (smiling proudly):**
“Perfect, Kanaad! You summarized it like a pro. That’s exactly the recipe.

And look — we already wrote the steps on the board:

1. Create console app + library.
2. Add Account class.
3. Add balance, deposit, withdraw.
4. Add delegate.
5. Add event based on delegate.
6. Raise event inside Withdraw().
7. Create handler class.
8. Subscribe handler to event in Main().
9. Test.”

**Ravi (clapping hands together):**
“So now, let’s code this step by step. Don’t worry, I’ll go slow.
👉 You’ll watch first, then at 10:50, you will code along with me.
Fair deal?”

**Class (together):**
“Yes, Ravi!”

So my friends, let’s slow down and understand this carefully.
We just created two projects:

* **Banking.dll** → This is our *provider*. It has the reusable class `Account`.
* **BankingApp.exe** → This is our *consumer*. It will actually run, and inside its `Main()` we want to *consume* the `Account` class.

Now, tell me, if consumer wants to *use* the provider, what must it do?
Yes! It must **add a reference**.

That’s the keyword I used: **Add Reference**.

Think about it like this:

* You are building a car (the EXE).
* But the car engine (DLL) is made in a separate workshop.
* The car cannot run unless the engine is *mounted inside*.
* To mount it, you have to connect the car to the engine. In our .NET world, that connecting is called **adding a reference**.

So `.dll` projects act like **providers** (engines, reusable components).
The `.exe` projects act like **consumers** (cars, applications).

And the command for connecting them is:

```sh
dotnet add reference ../Banking/Banking.csproj
```

👉 What happens after this?
Your consumer (`BankingApp.exe`) will now *know* about the provider (`Banking.dll`).
That means in your Program.cs you can safely write:

```csharp
using Banking;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Account acc = new Account();
        acc.Balance = 67000;
        acc.Withdraw(5000);
        Console.WriteLine($"Final Balance: {acc.Balance}");
    }
}
```

Without that reference, compiler will shout at you:
*"The type or namespace `Banking` does not exist in the current context."*

So the moral of the story is:

* Write reusable logic in **class library (DLL)**.
* Write consuming code in **console/web (EXE)**.
* Then **connect them** with `dotnet add reference`.

That’s it! 🚀

**Ravi (mentor, leaning in):**
“Alright team, car and engine story clear? Super. Now we’ll *build it end-to-end* — solution, projects, reference — and then wire our **delegate + event** for the ‘under-balance’ business rule. You’ll see it fire in the console.”

### 1) Create solution + two projects

```bash
# new empty solution
dotnet new sln -n BankingSolution
cd BankingSolution

# provider: class library (the engine)
dotnet new classlib -o Banking

# consumer: console app (the car)
dotnet new console  -o BankingApp

# add both projects into the solution
dotnet sln add Banking/Banking.csproj
dotnet sln add BankingApp/BankingApp.csproj
```

**Ravi:** “Now mount the engine into the car — add the reference.”

```bash
cd BankingApp
dotnet add reference ../Banking/Banking.csproj
cd ..
```

### 2) Folder picture (what you should see)

```
BankingSolution/
├─ BankingSolution.sln
├─ Banking/           # DLL project (provider)
│  ├─ Banking.csproj
│  └─ Account.cs      # (we’ll add)
└─ BankingApp/        # EXE project (consumer)
   ├─ BankingApp.csproj
   ├─ Program.cs
   └─ AccountEventListener.cs   # (we’ll add)
```



## 3) Write the provider (DLL): `Banking/Account.cs`

**Ravi:** “We’ll define a **delegate**, an **event**, and raise it when a withdrawal would drop balance below ₹10,000. Notice: we *don’t* allow the withdrawal; we just raise the event.”

```csharp
namespace Banking
{
    // 1) Delegate type (signature for handlers)
    public delegate void UnderBalanceHandler(object sender, UnderBalanceEventArgs e);

    // 2) Event data
    public class UnderBalanceEventArgs : EventArgs
    {
        public decimal CurrentBalance { get; }
        public decimal MinimumRequired { get; }
        public decimal AttemptedWithdrawal { get; }

        public UnderBalanceEventArgs(decimal currentBalance, decimal minimumRequired, decimal attemptedWithdrawal)
        {
            CurrentBalance = currentBalance;
            MinimumRequired = minimumRequired;
            AttemptedWithdrawal = attemptedWithdrawal;
        }
    }

    // 3) Business entity
    public class Account
    {
        public const decimal MinimumBalance = 10000m;

        public string AccountNo { get; }
        public decimal Balance { get; private set; }

        // 4) Event declaration
        public event UnderBalanceHandler? UnderBalance;

        public Account(string accountNo, decimal openingBalance = 0m)
        {
            AccountNo = accountNo;
            Balance = openingBalance;
        }

        public void Deposit(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount <= 0) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(amount));
            Balance += amount;
        }

        public bool Withdraw(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount <= 0) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(amount));
            if (amount > Balance) throw new InvalidOperationException("Insufficient funds.");

            var newBalance = Balance - amount;

            // Rule: do NOT allow balance to drop below minimum. Raise event instead.
            if (newBalance < MinimumBalance)
            {
                OnUnderBalance(new UnderBalanceEventArgs(Balance, MinimumBalance, amount));
                return false; // block withdrawal
            }

            Balance = newBalance;
            return true;
        }

        protected virtual void OnUnderBalance(UnderBalanceEventArgs e)
            => UnderBalance?.Invoke(this, e);
    }
}
```

## 4) Write the consumer (EXE): subscribe and react

### `BankingApp/AccountEventListener.cs`

```csharp
using Banking;

public class AccountEventListener
{
    public void OnUnderBalance(object sender, UnderBalanceEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(
            $"[ALERT] Withdrawal blocked. Current: ₹{e.CurrentBalance}, " +
            $"Minimum: ₹{e.MinimumRequired}, Attempted: ₹{e.AttemptedWithdrawal}");
    }
}
```

### `BankingApp/Program.cs`

```csharp
using Banking;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var acc = new Account("A-001", openingBalance: 12000m);

        var listener = new AccountEventListener();
        acc.UnderBalance += listener.OnUnderBalance;   // subscribe

        Console.WriteLine($"Opening balance: ₹{acc.Balance}");

        acc.Withdraw(1500m); // ok -> 10500
        Console.WriteLine($"After 1500 withdrawal: ₹{acc.Balance}");

        var success = acc.Withdraw(800m); // would drop to 9700 -> blocked + event
        Console.WriteLine($"Attempted 800 withdrawal success? {success}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Final balance: ₹{acc.Balance}");
    }
}
```

## 5) Build & run

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project BankingApp
```

**Expected console (roughly):**

```
Opening balance: ₹12000
After 1500 withdrawal: ₹10500
[ALERT] Withdrawal blocked. Current: ₹10500, Minimum: ₹10000, Attempted: ₹800
Attempted 800 withdrawal success? False
Final balance: ₹10500
```

**Ravi (grinning):**
“See the magic? The **event** is our fire alarm; the **delegate** is the phone line; and your **listener** is security picking up the call. We didn’t hard-wire who reacts — we just *raised* the event. That’s clean, loosely-coupled design.”

### Mini hands-on (2 quick tweaks)

1. Add another listener that logs to a file — subscribe it too (multicast delegates).
2. Change `MinimumBalance` and see your app still work without touching the listener (open/closed principle in action).


**Kanaad (curious, raising hand):**
“Ravi, can you open that *bin* folder once? Both for `Banking` and `BankingApp`. What’s the difference?”

**Ravi (smiling, as if waiting for this question):**
“Ah, fantastic, Kanaad! Exactly the question I was hoping someone would ask.
Look here 👉 inside **Banking** project’s `bin` folder — what do you see?”

**Class (looking at screen):**
“A DLL!”

**Ravi:**
“Yes. Correct. Because `Banking` is a **class library project**, so when we build it, we get `Banking.dll`. That’s our *engine*.

Now watch closely… If I open the `bin` folder of **BankingApp** — our console app — what do we see?”

**Kanaad:**
“Both DLL *and* EXE!”

**Ravi (nodding):**
“Exactly! You’ll see `BankingApp.exe` and right next to it, a copy of `Banking.dll`.

👉 Why did that happen?
Because when we said:

```bash
dotnet add reference ../Banking/Banking.csproj
```

it told the build system: *Hey, whenever you compile `BankingApp`, also copy the provider DLL right here in the same output folder.*

So when you double-click or `dotnet run` the EXE, CLR knows — look in the same folder for required DLLs. It finds `Banking.dll`, loads it into process memory, and then your EXE runs happily with its engine mounted.

This is exactly how big enterprise apps work.
Think e-commerce:

* `ECommerce.Web.exe`
* `Cart.dll`
* `Orders.dll`
* `Payments.dll`
* `Auth.dll`

All of them sitting together in **bin**. That’s called **binary-level decoupling**.”

**Ravi (switching gears, energetic):**
“Now let’s step back. What have we achieved till now?
✅ Created solution
✅ Added console app + class library
✅ Added `Account` class with `Deposit` and `Withdraw`
✅ Tested basic balance logic

That was **Sprint 1**.

Now I want Sprint 2 → make this `Account` *event-driven*. For that, friends, we need a new .NET datatype called **delegate**.”

**Ravi (writing on screen):**
“Look, I add a new file `AccountOperation.cs`:

```csharp
namespace Banking;

public delegate void AccountOperation();
```

Simple line. Looks like a function, right? But it’s not a function. It’s a **delegate**.

👉 What is a delegate?
Think of it as a *function pointer in C# world*.
It can **store the address of a method** and then invoke it indirectly.”


**Ashish (jumping in):**
“Ravi, suppose I add a new function in `Account.cs`. Do I need to re-run DLL build separately, or will EXE pick it up automatically?”

**Ravi:**
“Good question! When you say `dotnet run` at solution level, MSBuild is smart. It checks what changed. If `Banking` project code changed, it rebuilds DLL and then rebuilds `BankingApp` that depends on it. So yes, you just run the EXE, and updated DLL will be referenced. No manual step needed.”

**Ravi (returning to delegate):**
“So back to our story:
I define a delegate `AccountOperation`. Next, I create a new helper class — `AccountListener.cs`:

```csharp
namespace Banking.Handlers;

public static class AccountListener
{
    public static void BlockAccount()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Account blocked due to suspicious activity.");
    }

    public static void SendEmail()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Email sent to registered address.");
    }
}
```

Notice — it’s `static`. Why? Because these are utility methods; no object needed.

Now, in `Program.cs`, instead of calling `AccountListener.BlockAccount()` directly, I do this:

```csharp
using Banking;
using Banking.Handlers;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        AccountOperation agent = new AccountOperation(AccountListener.BlockAccount);
        agent();  // indirect call!

        agent = new AccountOperation(AccountListener.SendEmail);
        agent();  // indirect call!
    }
}
```

**Ravi (turns to class):**
“See the difference?

* Direct call: you explicitly write `AccountListener.BlockAccount()`.
* Indirect call: you say `agent();` → and behind the scenes, delegate calls the method.

This is late-binding, dynamic linking. At compile time, we don’t know *which function will run*. At runtime, CLR resolves it.

That, my friends, is the **first baby step toward event handling**. Events in C# are nothing but delegates under the hood, with some rules.”


**Nitheesh (curious):**
“Ravi, but why bother with indirect call if we can just call the method directly?”

**Ravi (smiling):**
“Superb! That’s the exact doubt you should have. The answer: **callbacks**.

When an event happens — say withdrawal fails — your `Account` class shouldn’t know *who* will respond. It just raises the event.
Subscribers (listeners) are invoked indirectly through delegates. That’s loose coupling, dynamic linking, and the foundation of event-driven systems.”

**Arif (hesitant, scratching head):**
“Ravi, I have one doubt. I’m not fully clear how the linkage is happening. You wrote `delegate` in one place, then `AccountListener` with static methods in another place, and then in `Program.cs` you just said `agent = new AccountOperation(AccountListener.BlockAccount);`. But how are they *connected*? We didn’t write any extra code that says ‘link this delegate with that function’. How exactly does it know?”

**Ravi (smiling, patient tone):**
“Excellent! That’s the exact confusion many people have the first time. Let me unwrap it slowly.

See here — you have your **listener methods**:

* `BlockAccount()`
* `SendEmail()`

They are just methods sitting in `AccountListener` class. Nothing magical yet.

Now, when in `Main()` you write:

```csharp
AccountOperation agent = new AccountOperation(AccountListener.BlockAccount);
```

👉 This line is the bridge.
At that moment, an *object of delegate type* is created. That delegate object doesn’t store data. It stores the **address of a function** — in this case, the address of `BlockAccount`.

So think of `agent` like a wrapper object, holding a pointer:
`agent --> BlockAccount()`

When you call `agent();` the delegate says:
‘Oh, I have the address of BlockAccount stored. Let me go and execute it.’

That’s how linkage happens — not by extra code, but by the *constructor call of the delegate itself*.”

**Arif (relieved):**
“Okay, so that `new AccountOperation(...)` is not just variable declaration — it’s actually object creation of delegate?”

**Ravi:**
“Spot on! That’s why I kept asking: Are we declaring or creating an object? The answer is: creating. And the object is not from your class — it’s from the delegate itself. This delegate object wraps the address of whichever method you passed.”


**Arif (still thinking):**
“And Ravi, can we add multiple methods into the same delegate object?”

**Ravi (smiling, walking to whiteboard):**
“Great follow-up! Yes. Delegates can maintain a list of method addresses.

So in `Main()` if I write:

```csharp
agent += AccountListener.SendEmail;
```

Now what happens?

* First, `agent` already pointed to `BlockAccount`.
* With `+=`, it adds `SendEmail` also into the list.

So behind the scenes, `agent` now looks like:
`[ BlockAccount() , SendEmail() ]`

But when you call `agent();`, it looks like just *one* call. Yet internally it will invoke both methods in sequence.

👉 This is called a **multicast delegate**. One delegate object chaining multiple listeners.”

**Ahtsham (curious):**
“So Ravi, can we add methods from *different classes* also into the same delegate?”

**Ravi:**
“Absolutely! As long as their signatures match the delegate type. So `AccountOperation` delegate says: *methods with no parameters, returning void*. Any method — in any class — with that signature can be attached.”

**George (jumping in):**
“But Ravi, why are your listener methods static? Can’t they be normal instance methods?”

**Ravi:**
“Good eye, George! They *can* be instance methods too. In that case, when you attach them, you’ll write:

```csharp
AccountListener listener = new AccountListener();
agent += listener.BlockAccount;
```

Here the delegate not only stores the method address but also which object to call it on.

But to keep our first example simple, I made them `static` — no need to create objects just for utility functions.”

**Nitheesh (asking a bigger question):**
“Ravi, but events in C# — they can’t call methods directly, right? They always need a delegate?”

**Ravi (smiling wide, as if waiting for this moment):**
“Exactly, Nitheesh! That’s the next step.

* First, you must understand delegate = type-safe function pointer.
* Then, multicast delegate = one delegate object calling multiple methods.
* Finally, events = delegates with some extra rules.

Events are built on top of delegates. Without delegates, you cannot have events. That’s why we’re spending time here first.”

**Ravi (turns back to screen):**
“Now let’s apply this to our `Account` class. Until now, `Withdraw` just reduced balance. But now, let’s make it *event-driven*.

In `Account.cs`, I add:

```csharp
public event AccountOperation UnderBalance;
```

This says: our Account object has an event called `UnderBalance`, and its type is `AccountOperation` (the delegate we wrote).

Now inside `Withdraw`:

```csharp
public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
{
    if (amount > 0 && amount < Balance)
    {
        Balance -= amount;
        if (Balance < 10000)
        {
            // trigger the event
            UnderBalance?.Invoke();
        }
    }
}
```

See the beauty? Account doesn’t *call* any function directly. It just raises the event. Whoever subscribed will get notified.”

**Ravi (switching to Program.cs):**

```csharp
Account acc = new Account();
acc.UnderBalance += AccountListener.BlockAccount;
acc.UnderBalance += AccountListener.SendEmail;

acc.Balance = 67000;
acc.Withdraw(66000);
```

**Ravi (turning to class):**
“Now tell me: did we call `BlockAccount()` or `SendEmail()` in this code? No!
Did Account class itself know about those methods? No!
Yet when balance dropped below 10,000 → *event fired* → delegate invoked all registered listeners → both messages printed.

That is event-driven programming.
Your `Account` is just a publisher. Listeners are free to attach. And that’s how you build decoupled, scalable systems.”

✅ By the end, Ravi has:

* Cleared the confusion about linkage (delegate object stores function address).
* Shown multicast delegate with `+=`.
* Explained static vs instance methods.
* Transitioned to **event-driven Account class** with real `UnderBalance` trigger.
