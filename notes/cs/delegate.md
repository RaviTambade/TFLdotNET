# Delegate

> *“Hey team, gather around. Today we’re about to unlock one of the most powerful yet misunderstood features of C#: the **Delegate**. Think of delegates as middlemen — like trusted agents who know which method to call when the time comes."*

Let’s begin our story…

## 🧩 What is a Delegate?

> Imagine you're organizing a tech event. You don’t know who will handle the keynote session, but you know what kind of speaker you need — someone who can deliver a 30-minute technical session.

That’s what a **delegate** is — it **represents the signature**, but the **method can be decided later**, at runtime.

📌 **Definition**: A delegate is a **type-safe object** that refers to a method with a specific **signature** and **return type**.

Just like a function pointer in C++, but safer and object-oriented.

## 📦 Step-by-Step: Using Delegates

Here’s the three-step mantra:

### 1. **Declaration**

> Like defining the *type of speaker* you want.

```csharp
delegate string strDelegate(string str);
```

### 2. **Instantiation**

> You found a speaker (method) that fits the role.

```csharp
strDelegate del = new strDelegate(MyObject.ReverseStr);
```

### 3. **Invocation**

> Showtime! You call the speaker to the stage.

```csharp
string output = del("Hello Transflower");
// or
string output = del.Invoke("Hello Transflower");
```

## 🧍‍♂️ Single Cast Delegate

This is a **one-on-one relationship**. One delegate, one method.

```csharp
delegate string strDelegate(string str);

strDelegate del = new strDelegate(obj.ReverseStr);
Console.WriteLine(del("Hello Mentor!"));
```


## 👥 Multi-Cast Delegate (The Delegate Party!)

> "What if I want **multiple methods** to be called one after another?"

Enter the **Multicast Delegate** — like calling multiple speakers to the stage in sequence.

```csharp
delegate void strDelegate(string str);

strDelegate del1 = new strDelegate(obj.UppercaseStr);
strDelegate del2 = new strDelegate(obj.LowercaseStr);

strDelegate group = del1 + del2;
group("Welcome to Transflower");
```

⚠️ **Note**: Multicast delegates only work **reliably with `void` return types**. Why? Because the **return value of only the *last* method is preserved**.

## 🔗 Delegate Chaining

You can explicitly **combine or remove** delegates using the `Delegate.Combine()` or `Delegate.Remove()` methods.

```csharp
CalDelegate add = new CalDelegate(obj.Add);
CalDelegate sub = new CalDelegate(obj.Subtract);

CalDelegate chain = (CalDelegate)Delegate.Combine(add, sub);
chain = (CalDelegate)Delegate.Remove(chain, add);
```

## 🚦 Asynchronous Delegate

> "What if my delegate method takes time (e.g., downloading, processing)?"

That’s when **asynchronous invocation** comes to the rescue!

```csharp
delegate string strDelegate(string str);

strDelegate del = new strDelegate(obj.ToUpper);
IAsyncResult result = del.BeginInvoke("transflower", null, null);
// Do other work...
string output = del.EndInvoke(result);
```

🎯 **Use case**: When you want to start the delegate call and **do something else while it’s executing**, then **retrieve the result later**.

## ✨ Anonymous Methods

> *"What if I don’t want to write a separate method at all? Just a quick one-liner!"*

```csharp
delegate string strDelegate(string str);

strDelegate del = delegate(string s) {
    return s.ToUpper();
};

Console.WriteLine(del("transflower"));
```

🎯 Anonymous methods are great for **passing quick behavior** into another function — like `foreach`, `events`, or UI event handlers.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways (Mentor Nuggets)

1. ✅ Delegates are **type-safe** method references — like pointers, but better.
2. ✅ They enable **methods as parameters**, making your code **flexible** and **extensible**.
3. ✅ Essential for **event handling**, **callback methods**, and **strategic method dispatching**.
4. ✅ Delegates can be **chained** or **combined** for broadcasting.
5. ✅ Support both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** executions.
6. ✅ Delegates are the **foundation** behind **Events**, **LINQ**, and **Func/Action** patterns in modern C#.
7. ✅ Even with same signature, two delegate types are **not interchangeable** — they must be the **exact same delegate type**.
8. ✅ They are **immutable** — once created, you can’t change the target method, only reassign.

## 🛠️ Bonus: `Func<>`, `Action<>`, `Predicate<>`

> *"Sir, these look like delegates but with fancy names!"*

Exactly. These are **built-in delegates**:

* `Func<string, int>` → takes string, returns int
* `Action<string>` → takes string, returns void
* `Predicate<int>` → takes int, returns bool

Use these when you want **cleaner syntax** without declaring custom delegate types.

## 🎓 Homework for You (Challenge)

Write a small app:

* Define a `Calculator` class with `Add`, `Subtract`, and `Multiply` methods
* Create a delegate `CalDelegate(int x, int y)`
* Use **delegate chaining** to call multiple operations
* Try **async delegate invocation**
* Try writing one **anonymous method** using `Action<string>`

## 🙋 Final Mentor Words

> “Delegates are not just a feature. They are the **gateway to flexible programming** in C#. Once you master them, you'll understand **events**, **callbacks**, and the real power of **.NET’s architecture**.”
