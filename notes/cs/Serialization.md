# Serialization

### ✨ "Ever wanted to freeze time?"

Imagine you’re playing a complex game. You’ve reached level 50, unlocked rare weapons, and now… you have to shut down your computer. 😱

But wait — the game lets you **save your progress**.

🔒 That, my dear students, is **serialization** in action.


## 📦 What Is Serialization?

Serialization is like **pressing the pause button** on an object. It captures everything — its data, structure, and state — and **writes it to a file**. You can later press play (i.e., **deserialize**) and pick up exactly where you left off.

In .NET, this is essential when you want to:

* Save objects to a file 🗂️
* Send them over a network 🌐
* Cache data between requests 🔄
* Share objects across applications 🤝


## 🧠 Think of it like packing a suitcase

* You’re going on a trip (saving the object)
* You pack your clothes into a suitcase (serialization)
* You ship it to your destination (store/send the file)
* At your destination, you unpack it (deserialization)

The object is safely restored — shirt by shirt, byte by byte.

  

## 🧪 Three Types of Serialization in .NET

### 🧊 1. **Binary Serialization** – The Compact One

💬 "Fast and efficient, but unreadable to humans."

Binary serialization writes the object's state in a compact, raw format.

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
// Serialize
BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();
formatter.Serialize(stream, person);

// Deserialize
Person person = (Person)formatter.Deserialize(stream);
```

❌ ⚠️ *Note*: `BinaryFormatter` is now **obsolete** in modern .NET. Avoid in production. Prefer JSON/XML.

  

### 📜 2. **XML Serialization** – The Readable One

💬 "Looks like HTML. Great for configs and human-friendly formats."

```csharp
XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Book));
serializer.Serialize(stream, book); // writes to book.xml
```

```csharp
Book book = (Book)serializer.Deserialize(stream);
```

✅ Human-readable
✅ Works well with web services

 

### 🌐 3. **JSON Serialization** – The Universal One

💬 "If you're building web apps or APIs, JSON is your best friend."

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the **most widely used** serialization format today.

```json
{
  "name": "Shiv",
  "gender": "Male",
  "birthday": "2000-08-09"
}
```

.NET Core uses `System.Text.Json`:

```csharp
var jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(employeeList);
File.WriteAllText("employees.json", jsonString);
```

```csharp
var employeeList = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Employee>>(File.ReadAllText("employees.json"));
```

 

## 🔧 Let's Build It: RepositoryManager Example

🎯 Your goal: Save and load a collection of `Employee` objects using JSON.

```csharp
public class RepositoryManager
{
    public void Serialize(List<Employee> employees, string fileName)
    {
        var options = new JsonSerializerOptions { IncludeFields = true };
        var employeesJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(employees, options);
        File.WriteAllText(fileName, employeesJson);
    }

    public List<Employee> DeSerialize(string fileName)
    {
        string jsonString = File.ReadAllText(fileName);
        List<Employee> employees = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Employee>>(jsonString);
        foreach (Employee emp in employees)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{emp.Id} : {emp.Name}");
        }
        return employees;
    }
}
```

👨‍🔬 Now your app can:

* Save employee data to a file (serialization)
* Load it anytime later (deserialization)
* Work offline or between sessions like a pro

 

## 🚀 Real-World Use Cases

* ✅ **Games**: Save checkpoints
* ✅ **Web APIs**: Send objects as JSON responses
* ✅ **Microservices**: Share state across services
* ✅ **Logging**: Store state snapshots during bugs

 

## ✅ Mentor's Advice to You

> “A skilled developer doesn’t just know how to write code — they know how to **persist, transport, and restore** that code’s behavior.”

Learn to serialize. Practice deserializing. And before you know it, you’ll be building apps that talk, share, and remember.
