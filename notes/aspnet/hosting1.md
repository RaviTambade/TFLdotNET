## **1. What Does “Hosting” Mean in .NET Core?**

Think of a .NET Core application like a **stage performance**:

* **Your code** = the play (actors, dialogues, props)
* **Hosting environment** = the theater (lights, seating, sound system)
* **Host** = the manager who:

  * Opens the theater doors
  * Arranges the seating
  * Starts and stops the show
  * Makes sure everything is ready for the audience (requests)

In .NET Core:

* The **Host** is the object responsible for **app startup, lifetime, and configuration**.

## **2. Types of Hosts in .NET Core**

Since .NET 6+, **Generic Host** is the standard.

### **a) Generic Host**

* Used for **all types** of .NET Core apps (Web, Worker services, Console apps)
* Supports:

  * Dependency Injection (DI)
  * Logging
  * Configuration
  * Lifetime events

### **b) Web Host** (Older ASP.NET Core style)

* Used only for web apps (before .NET 3.0)
* Now **wrapped inside Generic Host**

## **3. Hosting Building Blocks**

Here’s what happens when you create a .NET Core web app:

### **a) Program.cs (Host Builder)**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); // Creates the host
```

* Sets up:

  * **Configuration** (appsettings.json, env vars, etc.)
  * **Logging** (Console, Debug, etc.)
  * **Services** (DI registrations)

### **b) Startup Logic**

In older versions:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { ... }
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) { ... }
}
```

In minimal hosting model (.NET 6+):

```csharp
var app = builder.Build(); // Builds the host
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello Hosting!");
app.Run(); // Starts the host
```

### **c) Server**

* ASP.NET Core doesn’t talk to HTTP directly — it needs a **server implementation**.
* **Kestrel** = default cross-platform server.
* Can be hosted:

  * Directly (self-hosted with Kestrel)
  * Behind IIS, Apache, or Nginx (as reverse proxy)


### **d) Hosting Environment**

* Available via `IHostEnvironment` or `IWebHostEnvironment`
* Tells you:

  * `EnvironmentName` → Development, Staging, Production
  * `ContentRootPath` → physical location of the app
  * `WebRootPath` → wwwroot folder

```csharp
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}
```
### **e) Application Lifetime**

* You can hook into **start/stop events**:

```csharp
app.Lifetime.ApplicationStarted.Register(() =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("App started!");
});
```

## **4. Hosting Models in Deployment**

### **Self-Contained Deployment**

* Your app includes the .NET runtime.
* No need for runtime on the server.
* Larger file size.

### **Framework-Dependent Deployment**

* Uses runtime already installed on the server.
* Smaller size but needs runtime installed.

### **In-Process Hosting (IIS)**

* ASP.NET Core runs inside IIS worker process (`w3wp.exe`).
* Better performance.

### **Out-of-Process Hosting (IIS + Kestrel)**

* IIS acts as reverse proxy to Kestrel.
* More flexible, required for cross-platform hosting.

## **5. Typical Hosting Flow (Web App)**

1. **Create Host** → Load configs, logging, DI.
2. **Build Host** → Create HTTP pipeline & server.
3. **Run Host** → Listen for requests until shutdown.
4. **Shutdown** → Dispose services, close resources.

💡 **Mentor Tip:**
If you imagine **Hosting in .NET Core** as setting up a small restaurant:

* **Program.cs** = Lease and prepare the building (host setup)
* **Startup** = Hire the chef, buy ingredients (services, middleware)
* **Kestrel/IIS** = Waiters who take orders (HTTP server)
* **DI container** = Kitchen storage (shared resources)
* **App.Run()** = Open the restaurant doors
