## **gRPC – When You Want to Speak Fast, Clear, and Across Borders**

*"Imagine two friends — one in Japan, one in Brazil — trying to talk to each other. They speak different languages and live in different time zones. If they had a **translator** who could interpret instantly and a **superfast phone line** that never drops... wouldn’t that make their communication seamless?*

*That’s exactly what **gRPC** does — it acts as a smart translator and ultra-fast communicator between services, even if they’re built in different languages or on different machines."* 🌍

### ⚙️ What Is gRPC?

> gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a framework developed by Google that allows you to **call functions/methods across machines**, like calling a local function — but over the network.

It’s **not like REST** where you pass JSON in HTTP. Instead:

* 🧾 You define services and data using **Protocol Buffers (proto)**.
* 🚀 It uses **HTTP/2** for speed and bidirectional streaming.
* 🌐 It supports **cross-language** communication — C#, Java, Go, Python, Node.js, and more.
* 🔐 It can be secured using **TLS**, authenticated with **JWT**, and scaled with **load balancers**.


## 💻 Let’s Build a gRPC Service in .NET Core

*"Let me walk you through building a simple gRPC service that says Hello. Think of it like a polite receptionist who always greets you with a smile!"*

### 🔨 Step 1: Set up the gRPC Service

```bash
mkdir SimpleGrpcExample
cd SimpleGrpcExample
dotnet new grpc -n SimpleGrpcService
```

This will scaffold a basic gRPC project.


### 📜 Step 2: Define the Contract with Protobuf

Open `Protos/Greeter.proto` and define your service:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
option csharp_namespace = "SimpleGrpcService";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

💡 Think of this like writing a formal "handshake agreement" between the client and the server — no assumptions, just clear contracts.


### 👨‍💻 Step 3: Implement the Logic

Edit `Services/GreeterService.cs`:

```csharp
public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply
        {
            Message = "Hello " + request.Name
        });
    }
}
```

This is your backend logic — the receptionist we mentioned earlier who handles greetings.


### ▶️ Step 4: Run the Service

```bash
dotnet run
```

Boom! Your gRPC server is live at `https://localhost:5001`.



## 💬 Now Let’s Build the gRPC Client

> "The client is like a guest walking into the office and asking the receptionist for a hello. Let’s build that polite guest."



### Step 1: Create the Client App

```bash
mkdir SimpleGrpcClient
cd SimpleGrpcClient
dotnet new console
```


### Step 2: Add Required Packages

```bash
dotnet add package Grpc.Net.Client
dotnet add package Google.Protobuf
dotnet add package Grpc.Tools
```

Also, add the `.proto` file to your project, and configure it in `.csproj` like this:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Protobuf Include="../SimpleGrpcService/Protos/Greeter.proto" GrpcServices="Client" />
</ItemGroup>
```

---

###  Step 3: Create the Client Logic

Create `GreeterClient.cs`:

```csharp
using Grpc.Net.Client;
using SimpleGrpcService;

class GreeterClient
{
    private readonly Greeter.GreeterClient _client;

    public GreeterClient(GrpcChannel channel)
    {
        _client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
    }

    public string SayHello(string name)
    {
        var reply = _client.SayHello(new HelloRequest { Name = name });
        return reply.Message;
    }
}
```

---

### Step 4: Use the Client in `Program.cs`

```csharp
using System;
using Grpc.Net.Client;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
        var greeterClient = new GreeterClient(channel);
        var response = greeterClient.SayHello("John");
        Console.WriteLine($"Response from gRPC service: {response}");
    }
}
```

---

### Step 5: Run the Client

```bash
dotnet run
```

✅ Output:

```
Response from gRPC service: Hello John
```


##  Final Thoughts from Your Mentor

> *“In the modern microservices world, REST is like postal service — reliable, but slow. gRPC is like WhatsApp Voice Call — compact, fast, and real-time.”*

Use gRPC when:

* You need **real-time streaming** (telemetry, chat, IoT).
* You want **high performance** and **small payloads**.
* Your services talk **internally across multiple platforms**.

Use REST when:

* You want to expose APIs to the **public web**.
* Clients include browsers or mobile apps that expect JSON.
