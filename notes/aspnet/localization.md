# Localization in ASP.NET Core — “Speaking Your User’s Language”

> “Imagine you walk into a bakery in Spain, and the menu is only in German. Would you feel comfortable ordering? Probably not. That’s why we localize our applications — to speak *our user’s* language, not ours.”

## 🌍 Globalization vs Localization — What's the Difference?

Let me break it down simply:

* **Globalization** is like preparing your bakery to serve customers from anywhere — making sure your kitchen, menu system, and ingredients can handle different tastes and diets.
* **Localization** is when you **actually** write the menu in Spanish for customers in Spain. Or in Marathi for Pune customers.

In software, localization ensures our app **talks to users in their own language** — labels, buttons, messages, everything.

## 📁 Resource Files — The Language Dictionaries

We use `.resx` resource files to store translations. Think of them as **dictionaries**:

* One for English
* One for Spanish
* One for Marathi
* And so on...

Each file contains **key-value pairs** — like:

| Key      | Value (en)  | Value (es) |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Greeting | Hello World | Hola Mundo |

And the best part? Your code never changes. You just swap the resource file based on the user's culture.

## 🗂️ File Structure – Keep it Organized!

Put your resources in a folder called `Resources`. Follow this naming pattern:

```
Resources/Controllers.HomeController.en.resx
Resources/Controllers.HomeController.es.resx
```

📌 Tip: Use the controller or class name in the file so ASP.NET Core knows which resource to bind.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup — Let’s Build It

### ✅ Step 1: Add Localization Services

In `Program.cs`, tell your app where the resource files live:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddLocalization(options => options.ResourcesPath = "Resources");
```

### 🌐 Step 2: Set Supported Cultures

```csharp
var supportedCultures = new[]
{
    new CultureInfo("en-GB"),
    new CultureInfo("es")
};

builder.Services.Configure<RequestLocalizationOptions>(options =>
{
    options.DefaultRequestCulture = new RequestCulture("en-GB");
    options.SupportedCultures = supportedCultures;
    options.SupportedUICultures = supportedCultures;
});
```

We’re saying: “Hey app, by default speak English, but Spanish is also welcome!”

### 🚪 Step 3: Enable Culture Middleware

Add this line before `app.UseAuthorization();`

```csharp
app.UseRequestLocalization(
    app.Services.GetRequiredService<IOptions<RequestLocalizationOptions>>().Value);
```

This middleware **reads the culture** from request headers or query string and sets it accordingly.

## 🧾 Using IStringLocalizer — Let Your App Speak

ASP.NET Core provides this magical interface:

```csharp
IStringLocalizer<HomeController>
```

It connects your controller to the right `.resx` file automatically.

### 👨‍💻 Sample Controller: `HomeController`

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IStringLocalizer<HomeController> _localizer;

    public HomeController(IStringLocalizer<HomeController> localizer)
    {
        _localizer = localizer;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        ViewData["Greeting"] = _localizer["Greeting"];
        return View();
    }
}
```

No `if-else`, no language switch — just ask the localizer for `"Greeting"`, and it’ll get the correct translation!

### 🖼️ Index View: Show the Message

```cshtml
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "IStringLocalizer";
}

<div class="text-center">
    <p>@ViewData["Greeting"]</p>
</div>
```

### 🔍 Test It: Use Query String to Set Language

Navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5286/Home?culture=es
```

Boom 💥 — now your greeting shows in Spanish: **Hola Mundo!**

Try `?culture=en-GB` — back to English: **Hello World!**


## 💡 Mentor’s Insight

> “Don’t hard-code your app’s voice. Let it learn the user’s language.”

Using localization not only improves accessibility and inclusivity, but also shows your users that you **respect their culture**.

Whether you're building a local business site or a global SaaS app, **localized user experience = more trust = better adoption**.


📌 Ready to try with other languages like Hindi, Marathi, or French?
Just create more `.resx` files and you’re all set!
