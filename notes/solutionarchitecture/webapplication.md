# Web Application Architecture

**Web Application Architecture** is the layout or structure of all components involved in delivering web-based applications. It describes how the frontend (client-side), backend (server-side), and infrastructure (e.g., databases, servers, load balancers) interact to provide a smooth user experience.

### üß± **Layered Architecture: Vertical and Horizontal Layers**

### üìè **Horizontal Layers**  
(Also called *functional* or *logical* layers.)

- These are **stacked one over the other**, horizontally.
- Each layer has a **specific role** or responsibility.
- They **process requests step-by-step** from top (client) to bottom (database) and send responses back.
- **Example:**
  - **Presentation Layer** (UI / Frontend)
  - **Application Layer** (Handles workflows)
  - **Domain Layer** (Business rules)
  - **Data Access Layer** (Database operations)

üëâ **Horizontal layers = What the app *does* step-by-step.**

---

### üß© **Vertical Layers**  
(Also called *cross-cutting concerns*.)

- These **cut across** multiple horizontal layers.
- They provide **common functionalities** needed in many parts of the system.
- **Example:**
  - **Authentication** (Login checks in UI + backend)
  - **Logging** (Track events/errors in all layers)
  - **Error Handling** (Catch and report errors at any step)
  - **Configuration Management** (Settings used everywhere)

üëâ **Vertical layers = Common services used *across* steps.**

---

### üß† **Simple Analogy**  
Imagine building a **multi-story house**:

- **Floors** (Ground floor, First floor, Second floor) = **Horizontal layers** (Each floor has a role: living, dining, sleeping).
- **Pillars, plumbing, wiring** = **Vertical layers** (Support the whole building from bottom to top).

### ‚úÖ **Summary Table**

| Aspect              | Horizontal Layers           | Vertical Layers             |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Meaning             | Functional separation        | Cross-cutting concerns       |
| Flow Direction      | Top to bottom                | Across multiple layers       |
| Examples            | Presentation, Domain, Data Access | Authentication, Logging, Error Handling |
| Goal                | Structure of functionality   | Reusable, supportive services |

### üåê **Core Components of Web Application Architecture**

1. **Frontend (Client-side)**  
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue.js)
   - Runs in the user's browser
   - Interacts with backend via APIs

2. **Backend (Server-side)**  
   - Business logic, authentication, database interaction
   - Built with languages/frameworks like Node.js, Django, ASP.NET, Spring Boot

3. **Database**  
   - Stores persistent data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

4. **API Layer**  
   - REST or GraphQL endpoints for client-server communication

5. **Infrastructure Layer**  
   - Servers, cloud services, CDN, security, monitoring, deployment

### üìê **Horizontal Layers (Functional Layers)**

These define what each layer does (function-wise) and are **stacked** vertically in architecture diagrams.

1. **Presentation Layer (UI Layer)**  
   - What users see and interact with  
   - E.g., web pages, forms, dashboards

2. **Application Layer (Service Layer)**  
   - Coordinates business logic and app rules  
   - Handles user commands, validations, workflows

3. **Domain Layer (Business Logic Layer)**  
   - Core logic that reflects business rules  
   - Entities, services, domain events

4. **Data Access Layer (Persistence Layer)**  
   - Interacts with the database or storage systems  
   - CRUD operations, ORM (e.g., Entity Framework, Hibernate)

5. **Infrastructure Layer**  
   - Logging, caching, messaging, file systems, external integrations

---

### üß≠ **Vertical Layers (Cross-Cutting Concerns or Modular Areas)**

These are **sliced** vertically and focus on modularization or concerns that span across layers.

Examples:

- **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Configuration Management**
- **Error Handling**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Multitenancy Support**
- **Localization/Internationalization**

Each vertical concern can "cut through" multiple horizontal layers. For example, logging might be needed in UI, service, and data access layers.

### üèóÔ∏è **Example Layout of a Web App Architecture**

```
[ Client (Browser) ]
        ‚Üì
[ Presentation Layer ]
        ‚Üì
[ Application Layer ]
        ‚Üì
[ Domain Layer ]
        ‚Üì
[ Data Access Layer ]
        ‚Üì
[ Database / External APIs ]
```

üí° Cross-cutting vertical layers:  
```
| Logging | Auth | Error Handling |
|         (across all layers)     |
```

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Layered Architecture

- **Separation of concerns**
- **Easier testing and debugging**
- **Improved scalability and maintainability**
- **Independent development and deployment**
